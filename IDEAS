Acoustics Ideas:
- Simple database
- Simple web interface (queue, search, change volume)
- VLC-backed player

Database:
- songs(song_id, path, artist, album, title, length)
- votes(song_id, who, player_id, time)
- players(player, volume, song_id)

Player:
- vlc with "rc" interface
- replaygain

Web interface:
- reorder queue
- aggressive dedup view
- push mode so clients can get real-time data
- keep it fast

Queue is round-robin by person, tries to satisfy the most number of votes with a
single play.
